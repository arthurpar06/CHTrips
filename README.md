# Trips

CH Trips is a module platform to provide the barebones for sequenced pirep flights.

**For End Users**
Trips is a robust free flight system that allows for tracking of progress on a sequence of flights

**For Developers**
Trips's robust database schema, events, and services, creates a unified platform to build other modules with Trips centralizing the events, ensuring that phpVMS performance isn't lost by multiple plugins doing the same thing.

## Features

- Pilots can create multi-leg free flights, give the grouping of flights names.
- Centralized tracking of trip progress, along with a intuitive UI that prevents trip flights from being flown out of order.

## Future Features

- Multiple pilots can participate on a single trip, each taking a leg of a flight
  - This is great for if you're flying a prop plane around the world, one pilot can take x legs, another pilot can take y legs.
- Trip Management Admin UI

## Installation

1. Download the latest Release from the releases tab
2. Place the module within the Modules Directory of phpVMS
3. Enable the Module in phpVMS, then clear your caches and re-enter the admin panel to verify database migrations have been run successfully.
